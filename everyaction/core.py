    # This decorator uses consistencies and parameters (e.g., max value for top in a paginated request) in the
    # EveryAction API to "configure" how the request data and arguments are processed, how the request is sent, and how
    # the response data is processed in order to avoid repeating common logic. In fact, all of the logic for the
    # requests methods are implemented in this decorator: the methods themselves are placeholders existing for
    # documentation purposes.

    # Here is a description of each argument:

    # path_template: An API path which may use literal braces {} to indicate path parameters. See _parse_path_params
    # above for more info.

    # req_type: The request type (GET, PUT, etc.)

    # query_arg_keys: The names of the query args relevant for this request, excluding $expand, $skip, and $top which
    # are handled specially. Such names must resolve to a EAProperty (more on how this is done below), and the aliases
    # for that property may be used by the user to specify query args for this request.

    # paginated: Indicates whether the wrapped method will be for a paginated request. In the case that it is, the
    # keyword arguments "limit" and "skip" may be specified (more below), and the result of the request should be a
    # list.

    # max_top: Indicates what the maximum value for the $top query argument is for this request. When not specified and
    # paginated=True, _DEFAULT_MAX_TOP is assumed.

    # path_params_to_data: Indicates which path arguments should be copied as keys in data. At the time of writing, this
    # is currently only used for convenience in services.Events.patch.

    # prop_keys: The names of properties relevant for the JSON data of this request. Each name must resolve to an
    # EAProperty. Typically, prop_keys is used for JSON data keys which are not implicit in the EAObject associated with
    # this request, if any (see data_type below for more info).

    # props: Mapping from property names to EAProperty which are relevant to this request. This is sparsely used, as it
    # is preferred to use this parameter only when a property name conflicts with a more commonly used property.
    # Otherwise, the preference is to either get the property implicitly from data_type, or to specify it as a common
    # EAProperty via EAProperty.add.

    # data_type: The type of objects represents by the JSON data of this request. The purpose of specifying the type
    # here is solely as a convenient means of specifying a common set of properties for a method. Usage of the EAObjects
    # directly is unnecessary by the user, who may use keyword arguments of the names or aliases of the properties of
    # that object instead if they desire.

    # has_result: When True, response processing is foregone other than checking for an exception and the method returns
    # early.

    # result_array: When True, the structure of response data is assumed to be a list of objects which are individually
    # processed using result_factory.

    # result_array_key: When specified, the structure of response data is assumed to be a mapping with only this key,
    # with its value being a list of objects to be individually processed using result_factory.

    # result_key: When specified, the structure of response data (or of individual objects in array data) is assumed
    # to be a mapping with only this key, with its value being the data to return in this method. The purpose of this
    # parameter is to conveniently extract single-element maps for the user so they may avoid the frivolous step of
    # extracting a mapping value.

    # result_factory: When specified, the response data (or of individual objects in array data) is processed by calling
    # this, usually resulting in an EAObject corresponding to an EveryAction API object. Typically, the value for this
    # parameter is just a subclass of EAObject, and calling it just instantiates that object using its constructor.
    # Sometimes it is a more complicated factory, though.

    # exclude_keys: When specified, exclude these keys from the resulting data. Useful when multiple keys are returned
    # for the same property (i.e., both locationId and id in response data for a Location) and one must be suppressed
    # to prevent an error being raised in the constructor.

    # none_if_404: When specified, return None rather than erroring upon receiving a response with status code 404.

    # How EAProperty objects are resolved:
    # Firstly, if data_type is specified, data_type._properties() populates the collection of properties.
    #
    # Then, any properties specified in props populates the collection, overriding any which were already present.
    #
    # Finally, any properties specified in prop_keys, query_arg_keys, and/or path_params_to_data are assumed to be
    # common properties accessible via EAProperty.get if they were not specified by props; if they cannot be resolved
    # this way, an AssertionError is raised.
    #
    # Note that query_arg_keys, prop_keys, path_params_to_data are assumed to have no common keys (as that would be
    # redundant), and if they do, an AssertionError in raised.
    #
    # These keys are likewise assumed to be disjoint from the keys of data_type._properties(), as a need to specify
    # repeat keys in this way never arose and likely indicates a mistake, and thus an AssertionError is raised.
    #
    # Additionally, prop_keys and props are assumed to have no common keys (as that is likewise redundant), and if they
    # do, an AssertionError is raised.
    #
    # If the properties pass all checks, the collection is used to instantiate an EAProperties object, which will be
    # used to resolve aliases given by the user when calling this method.
